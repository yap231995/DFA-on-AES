# Classical DFA on AES
1. AES design from scratch based on https://github.com/boppreh/aes/blob/master/aes.py and the book The Rjindael Design.
2. Differential Fault attack on round 9 in Python and C.
3. Differential Fault attack on round 8 in C.

For the program written in C.
For the simple DFA on Encryption on 8th Round, it ran 11 hrs on my computer,
while the DFA on Encryption on 8th Round with 2 phases takes 3.5hrs on my computer. 
For the 9th round Encryption it took roughly 2-5 mins. 

For program written in Python,
It took 3.5hrs to run the 9th round Encryption.
